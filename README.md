## About this fork

This repo is a fork of Mu2hr00m's NovaSaga. There were many inconsistencies in formatting and other various issues in the original, so I created this fork to patch various bugs as well as adding additional features. This fork is still unmerged to the upstream. Sadly, the creator stated that they would not be merging this repo into main until next year at least, so this branch will remain up-to-date with the main branch to ensure that it is compatible when it is eventually merged.
